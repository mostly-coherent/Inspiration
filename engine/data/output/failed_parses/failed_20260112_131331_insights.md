# Failed Parse
Mode: insights

Perfect! The draft is now complete with all your refinements:

**Final Structure:**
- **Hook:** The "oops" moment where Composer caught Sonnet's blind spot
- **Story:** Multi-tasking → forgot to switch models → Architect built facade with no plumbing
- **Insight:** Proactive peer review at AI speed (not reactive debugging)
- **Close:** 3-role question (Architect, Builder, QA)
- **Visual Evidence:** Screenshot of Sonnet's admission queued for first comment

**Key Improvements Made:**
1. ✅ Added your typical model usage (Sonnet=Planning, Opus=Coding)
2. ✅ Changed "lazy" → "multi-tasking and forgot to switch" 
3. ✅ Added "asked me to test it out" for better setup
4. ✅ Shifted from "debugging time" to "proactive peer review value"
5. ✅ Updated closing to reflect 3 roles (Architect, Builder, QA)
