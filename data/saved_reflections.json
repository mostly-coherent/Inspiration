    "counterPerspective": "What if getting trapped in local maxima is actually a necessary part of developing genuine expertise and deep understanding?",
    "reasoning": "While local maxima can feel like traps, they might represent essential periods of mastery that build the foundation for recognizing when to make strategic leaps. Deep optimization in one area often reveals principles that transfer broadly.",
    "suggestedAngles": [
      "Local mastery as pattern recognition training - deep optimization teaches you to recognize similar efficiency opportunities across domains",
      "The compound value of 'wasted' expertise - seemingly narrow technical skills often become unexpectedly valuable in new contexts",
      "Strategic patience vs. premature pivoting - distinguishing between productive depth-building and actual stagnation"
    ],
    "reflectionPrompt": "Next time you catch yourself going deep on optimization, ask: 'What transferable principles am I learning here that might apply beyond this specific problem?'",
