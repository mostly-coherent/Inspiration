# Use Cases for: Report a bug to Cursor

## Item 1: Ghost Folder Bug Investigation

**Job-to-be-Done:** Debug why a deleted folder keeps reappearing in the file system, causing confusion and potential workflow issues.

**How It Was Done:** Systematic investigation revealed that Cursor creates ghost folders when referencing non-existent paths in chat (using `@MyPrivateTools/Inspiration` after moving the project to root). The ghost folder only contained build cache files, not source code. Solution involved deleting the ghost folder and updating chat references to use the correct path.

**Takeaway:** When encountering persistent file system issues with development tools, check if the tool itself is creating artifacts based on references or commands. Document the root cause and prevention steps for future reference.

This example shows a methodical approach to investigating and documenting tool-specific bugs - exactly the kind of systematic thinking that would be valuable when reporting issues to Cursor's team.
