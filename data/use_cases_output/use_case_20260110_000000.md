# Use Cases for: building features with AI assistance

Found 8 relevant examples from your chat history:

## Item 1: Inspiration App - Mining Chat History for Ideas

**Job-to-be-Done:** Extract actionable insights and ideas from accumulated Cursor chat conversations to avoid losing valuable patterns and learnings from agentic coding sessions.

**How It Was Done:** Built Next.js app with Python backend that processes Cursor chat databases, uses LLM to generate insights/ideas with judge-only mode, then harmonizes outputs into persistent banks (JSON + Markdown) to eliminate duplicates and organize by actionability.

**Takeaway:** When building with AI assistance generates lots of conversations, create systems to mine and consolidate the valuable patterns rather than letting insights get buried in chat history.

## Item 2: AI Sales Assistant PRD - Structured Feature Planning

**Job-to-be-Done:** Create comprehensive product requirements for AI-powered sales assistant enabling Channel Account Managers to generate personalized pitches, discover pricing, and curate customer lists.

**How It Was Done:** Used Builder Brief format with tabulated functional requirements, data source mapping across multiple systems (VIPMP, Labrador, Databricks), progressive rollout vision, and clear P0/stretch goal distinctions for Alpha/Beta phases.

**Takeaway:** AI-assisted feature building benefits from structured documentation that clearly maps data sources, user flows, and phased rollout plans before diving into implementation.

## Item 3: Workspace Optimization with Claude Best Practices

**Job-to-be-Done:** Implement systematic approach to non-technical app building using Claude with proper context management, git workflows, and documentation standards across personal and work environments.

**How It Was Done:** Created tiered implementation (CLAUDE.md files, GitHub CLI, MCP servers), established minimal documentation philosophy, automated project scaffolding, and replicated setup across Builder_Lab and Adobe workspaces with different contexts.

**Takeaway:** Successful AI-assisted building requires upfront investment in workspace configuration, context management, and documentation templates that scale across projects.

## Item 4: LinkedIn Content Generation with Voice Consistency

**Job-to-be-Done:** Create authentic LinkedIn posts that maintain personal voice while leveraging AI assistance, avoiding AI slop patterns and ensuring content reflects genuine insights from work experience.

**How It Was Done:** Developed voice profile system with golden examples from actual posts, created AI slop detection prompts, implemented social post workflow with future-date naming conventions, and refined content through multiple voice compliance passes.

**Takeaway:** AI-assisted content creation requires explicit voice training, slop detection systems, and iterative refinement to maintain authenticity while gaining efficiency benefits.

## Item 5: Documentation Artifact Strategy - Two-Type Framework

**Job-to-be-Done:** Solve the problem of AI generating comprehensive but unreadable documentation by distinguishing between AI-alignment docs and human-communication docs.

**How It Was Done:** Established two-artifact approach: comprehensive documentation for agentic coding context (AI alignment, cursorrules) versus curated communicative artifacts for humans (specific angles, visual/interactive elements).

**Takeaway:** AI assistance changes documentation strategy - generate comprehensive context for AI, then surgically create human-digestible summaries rather than trying to make one document serve both purposes.

## Item 6: Cross-Platform Cursor Database Extraction

**Job-to-be-Done:** Make Inspiration app shareable by removing hardcoded paths and supporting different operating systems' Cursor database locations.

**How It Was Done:** Implemented cross-platform detection for Cursor databases, created settings wizard for workspace configuration, added voice profile system with golden examples, and modularized Python engine architecture.

**Takeaway:** When building AI-assisted tools for sharing, invest early in configuration systems and cross-platform compatibility rather than hardcoding personal setups.

## Item 7: Bank Harmonization System for Duplicate Content

**Job-to-be-Done:** Prevent accumulation of duplicate insights and ideas across multiple AI-generated output files while maintaining actionability and organization.

**How It Was Done:** Created JSON + Markdown bank system where LLM harmonizes new content by merging similar entries, adding novel ones, organizing by frequency/actionability, and auto-deleting source files post-harmonization.

**Takeaway:** AI-assisted workflows that generate lots of content need automated deduplication and organization systems to prevent information overload and maintain long-term value.

## Item 8: Progressive Feature Rollout Planning

**Job-to-be-Done:** Design AI sales assistant with clear expansion path from initial Channel Account Manager use case to broader organizational adoption.

**How It Was Done:** Created vision showing progressive rollout: CAMs → Partners → Developers → Support → general-purpose channel growth agent, with each phase building on previous capabilities and user feedback.

**Takeaway:** AI-assisted feature development benefits from explicit expansion planning that shows how initial narrow use cases can evolve into broader organizational tools.
