# Use Cases for: Performance optimization techniques and tactics for the Inspiration app

Found 8 relevant examples from your chat history:

## Item 1: Dynamic Viewport Height Fix for Mobile

**Job-to-be-Done:** Eliminate white space at bottom of mobile viewport caused by browser UI elements

**How It Was Done:** Replaced `h-screen` with `h-dvh` (dynamic viewport height) in CSS classes. This accounts for mobile browser UI that changes size and ensures layout fills exactly the visible viewport without gaps.

**Takeaway:** Use dynamic viewport units (`dvh`) instead of static screen height for mobile-responsive layouts that need to fill the entire visible area.

## Item 2: System Prompt Caching with TTL

**Job-to-be-Done:** Reduce LLM API costs and improve response times by avoiding repeated system prompt processing

**How It Was Done:** Implemented 5-minute TTL (time-to-live) caching for system prompts in the LLM integration. Added token management and cost optimization strategies alongside the caching layer.

**Takeaway:** Cache expensive, repetitive LLM operations like system prompts with appropriate TTL to balance cost savings with content freshness.

## Item 3: Memoization and Error Handling for React Components

**Job-to-be-Done:** Improve React app performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders during intensive operations

**How It Was Done:** Added React memoization to prevent unnecessary component re-renders and implemented comprehensive error handling with abort signal support in API routes for graceful operation cancellation.

**Takeaway:** Combine React.memo with proper error boundaries and abort signals to create performant, resilient user interfaces that handle intensive operations gracefully.

## Item 4: Delta-Based LLM Updates for Large Data

**Job-to-be-Done:** Overcome token limits when updating large JSON structures through LLM harmonization

**How It Was Done:** Switched from sending entire data banks to LLM to a delta-based approach where the LLM returns only changes/additions. This solved token limit issues when harmonizing 29+ insight files into structured banks.

**Takeaway:** For large data operations with LLMs, use delta/diff approaches instead of full payload updates to stay within token limits and reduce costs.

## Item 5: Progress Tracking with Time Estimates

**Job-to-be-Done:** Provide users with meaningful feedback during long-running operations instead of blank loading states

**How It Was Done:** Added progress bars with percentage completion and time estimates during generation processes. Included cost estimates and stop button functionality for user control.

**Takeaway:** Long operations need granular progress feedback with time estimates and cancellation options to maintain good UX during intensive processing.

## Item 6: Modular Architecture for Cross-Platform Support

**Job-to-be-Done:** Refactor hardcoded paths and platform-specific code to support open-source distribution across operating systems

**How It Was Done:** Created modular `engine/` directory with `common/` utilities, implemented cross-platform Cursor DB detection, added user configuration system with settings wizard, and OpenAI fallback support.

**Takeaway:** Design for portability from the start - use configuration systems and platform detection rather than hardcoded paths to enable cross-platform deployment.

## Item 7: Automated E2E Testing Without Manual Oversight

**Job-to-be-Done:** Ensure application reliability across all functionality without requiring manual testing supervision

**How It Was Done:** Implemented Playwright E2E testing with one command (`npm test`) that runs full test suite, auto-generates screenshots, and covers 10 core functionality tests. Applied same pattern to 11 other projects.

**Takeaway:** Invest in comprehensive E2E test automation that can run unsupervised - it pays dividends when scaling across multiple projects and enables confident deployments.

## Item 8: Bank System for Deduplication and Organization

**Job-to-be-Done:** Eliminate duplicate insights/ideas across multiple output files while maintaining searchable, organized knowledge base

**How It Was Done:** Created dual-format banks (JSON for structured data, Markdown for human reading) with LLM-powered harmonization that merges similar entries, adds novel ones, and organizes by frequency (High/Emerging). Auto-deletes source files post-harmonization.

**Takeaway:** For content aggregation systems, use dual storage formats - structured data for processing and human-readable formats for consumption, with automated deduplication to maintain quality.
